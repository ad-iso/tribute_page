      <li>
        <strong>1928</strong> - Aged 16, Turing encountered Albert Einstein's work;
        not only did he grasp it, but it is possible that he managed to deduce Einstein's questioning
        of Newton's laws of motion from a text in which this was never made explicit.
      </li>

        where he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics.</li>
      <li><strong>1936</strong> - Turing published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"</li>
